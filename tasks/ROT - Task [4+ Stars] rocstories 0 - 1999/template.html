ROT (Rule-of-Thumb) Writing Task

This HIT: Each worker writes 1-5 rules-of-thumb.
(The situation could be an original passage from somewhere, or an edit.)

Turkers will:
- read context
- write up one or more rules-of-thumb to explain what's going on

Generate with:
    python -m sc.mturk.layout.rot

                I am collecting rules-of-thumb to help computers understand
                how we expect people to behave in society. <b>I want rules-of-thumb
                    that explain what we consider good and bad behavior.</b>

            <p class="measure-wide lh-copy f5">
                You can <span class="b bg-yellow pa1">think of the computer like a five-year-old child who
                    doesn't know how the world works</span>.
                We have to explain the basics
                to them about what people think is right and wrong in society,
                and how our actions make other people feel.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mb1 mt4">Rule-of-thumb Requirements</h4>
            Remember the requirements for writing rules-of-thumb:

                    "swearing at your sister," and you want to write something like "It's rude to swear at your sister,"
                    consider instead writing "It's rude to swear at family members," or "It's rude to swear at others."
                    In

                    situation. Also, try explaining really basic expectations we have in

                    In general, I never plan to de-qual, reject, or block based on using
                    the "Unclear" box. It's meant to help you! Sometimes the data I'm
                    using as a source for the situations simply has bad or confusing sentences.
                    Of course, many workers find
                    ways to still write great ROTs for potentially vague situations,

                    I love these ROTs because they reveal several closely related <i>but distinct</i> expectations.
                    They untangle three ideas: (1) many of us expect
                    gifts on Christmas; (2) that if you don't get what you want from
                    your SO for a special occasion (maybe even beyond Christmas), you're actually justified in feeling a
                    little bad; (3) if you're
                    dating someone, we expect you know their preferences for presents.
                    There's a lot of nuance here, without the ROTs overlapping.

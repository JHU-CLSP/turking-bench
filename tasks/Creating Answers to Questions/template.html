<h3>Writing Answer Options for a Reading Comprehension Task</h3>

<p>&emsp;You are designing a reading comprehension test for your students. Students will read a <b>paragraph</b>; a <b>question</b> based on the paragraph; and a few <b>options</b> for its answer. They have to choose the <b>correct</b> answer from the options. For the test to make sense, you want the correct answer to be part of the options.<br />
&emsp;However, you don't want the test to be too easy! To make the test difficult for the students, you want to add <b>incorrect</b> options that might be confused with the correct answer to the list of options. A student who tries to answer a question without reading the paragraph carefully might choose the incorrect option! <b> In this task, your goal is to write the list of options that will be shown to your students.&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Below we show some good and bad examples of correct and incorrect options. We also show examples of bad questions.</p>

<div class="boxedBig"><b>Correct Options</b>: A correct option is one that <b><i>correctly and completely</i></b> answers the question. Keep in mind that for any question, there can be multiple correct answers. A bad correct option addresses the question only partially or incorrectly. We want to include only good correct options in the list of options. Here are some good and bad examples of correct options:

<div class="boxedBig">
<h4>Paragraph:</h4>
<b>Sent 1: </b> Obama was born on August 4, 1961, at Kapi ªolani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital in Honolulu, Hawaii.<br />
<b>Sent 2: </b> He is the only President to have been born in Hawaii.<br />
<b>Sent 3: </b> He was born to a white mother and a black father.<br />
<b>Sent 4: </b> His mother, Ann Dunham (1942-1995), was born in Wichita, Kansas, of mostly English descent, with some German, Irish, Scottish, Swiss, and Welsh ancestry.</div>

<div class="boxedBig"><b>Question: </b> How old was Obama's mother when he was born?<br />
<b><a style="color: green;">Good</a> Correct options </b> (separated via "//"): 19 // almost twenty<br />
<b><a style="color: red;">Bad</a> Correct option: </b> 20<br />
<b><a style="color: red;">Bad</a> Correct option: </b> older than twenty<br />
<b>Explanation: </b> Obama was born in 1961. His mother was born in 1942 and 1961-1942=19. The good options ('19' and 'almost twenty') answer the question correctly. The bad options give an incorrect answer.</div>

<div class="boxedBig"><b>Question: </b> Where was Ann living in August, 1961?<br />
<b><a style="color: green;">Good</a> Correct options </b>(separated via "//"): Honolulu // Hawaii<br />
<b><a style="color: red;">Bad</a> Correct option: </b> Kansas<br />
<b><a style="color: red;">Bad</a> Correct option: </b> Scotland<br />
<b>Explanation: </b> Ann is Obama's mother (Sent 4). She must have been there when Obama was born (Sent 1). Obama was born in Hawaii (Sent 2). Hawaii is also in Honolulu. So both Hawaii and Honolulu answer the question correctly. Kansas and Scotland don't answer the question correctly.</div>
</div>
&nbsp;

<div class="boxedBig"><b>Incorrect Options</b>: An incorrect option will be closely related to the content of the paragraph and/or the question but will not truthfully answer the question. They <b><i>should not be trivial</i></b>, in the sense that they <b><i>should not be easily eliminated as the answer</i></b> without reading the paragraph. They are presented as options to confuse your students and to make the reading comprehension task challenging for them. Here are some good and bad examples of incorrect options:

<div class="boxedBig">
<h4>Paragraph:</h4>
<b>Sent 1: </b> It was hot that day.<br />
<b>Sent 2: </b> The temperature on the wall of the backyard was showing something well over 100 F.<br />
<b>Sent 3: </b> Meanwhile Tom, at home, was trying finish the remainder of carrots from last night, and packing for his trip to Chicago tomorrow.<br />
<b>Sent 4: </b> As employees of the Art Museum, Tom and his older cousin often had to travel to Chicago.</div>

<div class="boxedBig"><b>Question: </b> What was the temperature outside, when Tom was eating carrots?<br />
<b><a style="color: green;">Good</a> Incorrect options </b> (separated via "//"): Not very hot // Far below 100 F<br />
<b><a style="color: red;">Bad</a> Incorrect option: </b> Carrots<br />
<b><a style="color: red;">Bad</a> Incorrect option: </b> Wall<br />
<b>Explanation: </b> The good options appear in the paragraph (at least partially). They are also related to the content of the question (temperature), but do not answer the question correctly. Your student will have to carefully read the paragraph to identify that these don't answer the question correctly. The bad options appear in the paragraph (e.g. Wall) and sometimes also in the question (e.g. carrots) but they are trivially incorrect. A student can easily determine that they don't answer the question correctly without even reading the paragraph.</div>

<div class="boxedBig"><b>Question: </b> What did Tom not visit?<br />
<b><a style="color: green;">Good</a> Incorrect options </b> (separated via "//"): Tom's older cousin // Art Museum of Chicago<br />
<b><a style="color: red;">Bad</a> Incorrect option: </b> A flower<br />
<b><a style="color: red;">Bad</a> Incorrect option: </b> Two Chitoz bags<br />
<b>Explanation: </b> The good options are closely related to the content of the paragraph and question, but do not answer the question correctly. Your student will have to carefully read the paragraph to identify that these don't answer the question correctly. The bad options are not in the paragraph at all, and don't challenge the student's comprehension skills.</div>

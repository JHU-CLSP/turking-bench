  <h1>Suggesting how-to articles</h1>
  <p>
      We are developing a tool that helps explain how to do certain tasks in daily life. For each question, please imagine you're reading an article about some  <strong>goal</strong>, which suggests a <strong>step</strong>. Then, you're presented with another article containing instructions. Please click open the new article and take a quick look. Are these instructions helpful for taking this <strong>step</strong>?
  </p>
  <p>
      <strong>If this is your first time doing this HIT, please click on "Instructions" on the upper-left corner to see examples and guidelines. Failure to do so will may result in HIT rejection.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>This HIT has 10 tasks. You should spend around 30 seconds on each task, and 5 minutes on this HIT, with an <b>hourly rate of 10 dollars</b>. Hint: To answer faster, you can use <strong>(Shift+)Tab</strong> to jump back and forth between candidates and use <strong>Space</strong> to select. </p>

  <short-instructions>
        <p>Here are some example scenarios and expected answers for most people. Use your own judgement when things aren't clear. </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example 1</strong>: Imagine you're reading an article about the goal <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Get-in-Shape" target="_blank">"Get in Shape"</a>, which includes a step "Eat balanced meals". Then, you're presented with a new article <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Maintain-a-Balanced-Diet" target="_blank">"Maintain a Balanced Diet"</a>. Does this new article help explain how to do the step?
          <br>
          You should choose: The article explains <strong>exactly</strong> how to do the step.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example 2</strong>: Imagine you're reading an article about the goal <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Train-a-Rescue-Dog" target="_blank">"Train a Rescue Dog"</a>, which includes a step "Train your dog to sit on command". Then, you're presented with a new article <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Train-a-Dog" target="_blank">"Train a Dog"</a>. Does this new article help explain how to do the step?
          <br>
          You should choose: The article is <strong>helpful</strong>, but it either doesn't have enough information or has too much unrelated information. The reason is that the new article is about generic dogs, not rescue dogs, while it definitely has unseful information.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example 3</strong>: Imagine you're reading an article about the goal <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Hang-Drywall-by-Yourself" target="_blank">"Hang Drywall by Yourself"</a>, which includes a step "Finish the drywall". Then, you're presented with a new article <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Finish-Wood" target="_blank">"Finish Wood"</a>. Does this new article help explain how to do the step?
          <br>
          You should choose: The article explains something <strong>related</strong>, but I don't think I can do the step with the instructions. The reason is that the new article is about finishing wood but not dry wall, and its information should not be helpful for finishing dry walls.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example 4</strong>: Imagine you're reading an article about the goal <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Care-for-Roses" target="_blank">"Care for Roses"</a>, which includes a step "Weed the soil to maintain a healthy plot". Then, you're presented with a new article <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Stop-Smoking-Weed" target="_blank">"How to Stop Smoking Weed"</a>. Does this new article help explain how to do the step?
          <br>
          You should choose: The article is <strong>unhelpful/unrelated</strong>. The reason is that the new article is about weed as a drug, which has nothing to do with weed as a plant.

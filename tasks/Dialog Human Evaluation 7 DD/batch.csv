If the House approves the bill, it is then sent to the Senate. If the Senate approves the bill, it is then sent to the President for signature.<br>Do all bills have to go through this process?<br>The Constitution requires that all bills related to revenue must originate in the House of Representatives. So if a bill deals with taxes, spending, or borrowing money, it must start in the House. Other bills can start in either the House or Senate, but most bills do start in the House. After a bill is introduced, it is assigned to a committee for further study. If the committee approves the bill, it goes to full House or Senate for debate and a vote.<br>What happens if the President doesn't sign a bill?<br>If the President vetoes a bill, it goes back to Congress with his or her objections. If two-thirds of both the House and Senate approve the bill, it becomes law even without the President's signature. This is called overriding a veto.","The baby is crying again .<br>Leave him alone , he ' ll soon stop .<br>How can you do so ? Perhaps something is wrong with him . Let ' s go and see him .<br>OK .

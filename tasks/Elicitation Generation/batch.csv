Write Creative Sentences,We'll give you a list of actions (plus ideas for who is doing the action).  You write a sentence where the action is done in a certain way / style.  Possible bonus for creativity.,creative write sentence transitivity nouns verbs writing generation bonus reward,affirmation,"<ul>

  <li> We'll show you an action (represented by a video), things that can do the
  action, and some things the action can be done to, and you'll write two
  sentences combining them together.

  <li> We're interested in how counterfactuals are expressed.  One sentence you
  write will be where the action definitely happened.  The other sentence is
  where the action probably didn't happen.  Try to use similar words in both.

  <li> The suggested things that can do the action or that can have the action
  done to them are ideas to get your creative juices flowing.  They came from
  other people on Mechanical Turk, so some of them might not make sense
  (nobody's perfect); if so, please ignore them.  You don't have to use the
  suggested things that can do the action or things that the action can be done
  to.  <b>The only requirement is that you use a form of the specified action
  and to have the sentence reflect that the action happened (or didn't, as the
  case may be).</b>

  <li> There are a number of ways that sentences might show that an action might
  not have happened.  It could be expressing fantasy, sarcasm, doubt, or plain
  negation.  Here are some examples where the <b>action probably didn't
  happen</b>:
       <ul>
        <li> <i>kiss</i>: I dreamed about Scarlet <i>kissing</i> me all night.
        <li> <i>help</i>: The government will <i>help</i> small business when pigs fly.
        <li> <i>fix</i>: Bob was too busy to <i>fix</i> the drain like I asked him to.
       </ul>

  <li> In contrast, there should be no doubt to an average reader that the action happened in the the other sentences you write.  

  <ul>

    <li> <i>kiss</i>: I saw a movie where Scarlet <i>kissed</i> Billy Bob.

    <li> <i>help</i>: The government <i>helped</i> me buy a house with a tax credit.

    <li> <i>fix</i>: Bob <i>fixed</i> the drain like I asked him to.

  </ul>

  <li> In rare cases, it might not be possible to write a sentence with the
  action and properties as given.  If so, click the box that says ""it's not
  possible to write such a sentence.""

  <li> We're not looking for simple negation like ""the dog didn't bark"" vs. ""the
  dog barked.""  Be <b>creative</b>!

  <li> Please make sure your sentences make sense and that you try to answer all
  of the questions.  Incomplete or incoherent responses will be rejected.

  <li> We'll pay a bonus for particularly creative sentences (something that
  makes sense and wouldn't look out of place in a book or newspaper).

Write Creative Sentences,We'll give you a list of actions (plus ideas for who is doing the action).  You write a sentence where the action is done in a certain way / style.  Possible bonus for creativity.,creative write sentence transitivity nouns verbs writing generation bonus reward,affirmation,"<ul>

  <li> We'll show you an action (represented by a video), things that can do the
  action, and some things the action can be done to, and you'll write two
  sentences combining them together.

  <li> We're interested in how counterfactuals are expressed.  One sentence you
  write will be where the action definitely happened.  The other sentence is
  where the action probably didn't happen.  Try to use similar words in both.

  <li> The suggested things that can do the action or that can have the action
  done to them are ideas to get your creative juices flowing.  They came from
  other people on Mechanical Turk, so some of them might not make sense
  (nobody's perfect); if so, please ignore them.  You don't have to use the
  suggested things that can do the action or things that the action can be done
  to.  <b>The only requirement is that you use a form of the specified action
  and to have the sentence reflect that the action happened (or didn't, as the
  case may be).</b>

  <li> There are a number of ways that sentences might show that an action might
  not have happened.  It could be expressing fantasy, sarcasm, doubt, or plain
  negation.  Here are some examples where the <b>action probably didn't
  happen</b>:
       <ul>
        <li> <i>kiss</i>: I dreamed about Scarlet <i>kissing</i> me all night.
        <li> <i>help</i>: The government will <i>help</i> small business when pigs fly.
        <li> <i>fix</i>: Bob was too busy to <i>fix</i> the drain like I asked him to.
       </ul>

  <li> In contrast, there should be no doubt to an average reader that the action happened in the the other sentences you write.  

  <ul>

    <li> <i>kiss</i>: I saw a movie where Scarlet <i>kissed</i> Billy Bob.

    <li> <i>help</i>: The government <i>helped</i> me buy a house with a tax credit.

    <li> <i>fix</i>: Bob <i>fixed</i> the drain like I asked him to.

  </ul>

  <li> In rare cases, it might not be possible to write a sentence with the
  action and properties as given.  If so, click the box that says ""it's not
  possible to write such a sentence.""

  <li> We're not looking for simple negation like ""the dog didn't bark"" vs. ""the
  dog barked.""  Be <b>creative</b>!

  <li> Please make sure your sentences make sense and that you try to answer all
  of the questions.  Incomplete or incoherent responses will be rejected.

  <li> We'll pay a bonus for particularly creative sentences (something that
  makes sense and wouldn't look out of place in a book or newspaper).

        <li> <i>kiss</i>: I dreamed about Scarlet <i>kissing</i> me all night.
        <li> <i>help</i>: The government will <i>help</i> small business when pigs fly.
        <li> <i>fix</i>: Bob was too busy to <i>fix</i> the drain like I asked him to.
       </ul>

  <li> In contrast, there should be no doubt to an average reader that the action happened in the the other sentences you write.  

  <ul>

    <li> <i>kiss</i>: I saw a movie where Scarlet <i>kissed</i> Billy Bob.

    <li> <i>help</i>: The government <i>helped</i> me buy a house with a tax credit.

  <li> In rare cases, it might not be possible to write a sentence with the
  action and properties as given.  If so, click the box that says ""it's not
  possible to write such a sentence.""

  <li> We're not looking for simple negation like ""the dog didn't bark"" vs. ""the
  dog barked.""  Be <b>creative</b>!

Write Creative Sentences,We'll give you a list of actions (plus ideas for who is doing the action).  You write a sentence where the action is done in a certain way / style.  Possible bonus for creativity.,creative write sentence transitivity nouns verbs writing generation bonus reward,benefit,"<ul>

  <li> We'll show you an action (represented by a video), things that can do the
  action, and some things the action can be done to, and you'll write two
  sentences combining them together.

  <li> We're interested in how the concept of benefit is expressed.  One
  sentence you write will be where the thing to which the action was done
  <b>benefited</b>.  The other sentence will be where the thing doing the action
  <b>was not affected</b>.

  <li> The suggested things that can do the action or that can have the action
  done to them are ideas to get your creative juices flowing.  They came
  from other people on Mechanical Turk, so some of them might not make sense
  (nobody's perfect); if so, please ignore them.  You don't have to use the
  suggested things that can do the action or things that the action can be done
  to.  <b>The only requirement is that you use a form of the specified action
  and to have the sentence reflect that the action benefited something (or not).</b>

  <li> There are a number of different reasons why sentences might have
  benefited.  The action changes the the object, or the action has some innate
  positive connotation, or the sentence makes it clear.  Here are some sentences
  where the thing to which the action is done benefits.

       <ul>
        <li> <i>save</i>: The St. Bernard <i>saves</i> the climber.
        <li> <i>help</i>: Patrick <i>helped</i> Joe pay his rent.
        <li> <i>gave</i>: Mary <i>gave</i> Bob a compliment.
       </ul>

Possible bonus for creativity.,creative write sentence transitivity nouns verbs writing generation bonus reward,aspect_volition,"<ul>

  <li> We'll show you an action (represented by a video), things that can do the
  action, and some things the action can be done to, and you'll write two
  sentences combining them together.

  <li> We're interested in how the concept of choice is expressed.  One sentence
  you write will be where the thing doing the action <b>actively chose to do the
  action</b>.  The other sentence will be where the thing doing the action
  <b>did not or cannot choose to do the action</b>.

  <li> The suggested things that can do the action or that can have the action
  done to them are ideas to get your creative juices flowing.  They came
  from other people on Mechanical Turk, so some of them might not make sense

  to.  <b>The only requirement is that you use a form of the specified action
  and to have the sentence reflect that a choice is (or is not) being made.</b>

  <li> There many different reasons why sentences have actions where choices are
not being made.  For example, the thing doing the action might have done it
automatically or might be incabable of making decisions.  Here are some examples
of sentences where choices are <b>not</b> being made.

       <ul>
        <li> <i>startle</i>: The picture <i>startled</i> George
        <li> <i>forget</i>: Sarah <i>forgot</i> Joe's name
        <li> <i>wash</i>: The sidewalk was <i>washed</i> by the rain.
       </ul>

  <li> Note that we're interested in choices being made, not the motivations
  behind the choices.  If someone is forced to do something, they still
  conciously decide to do it.

  <li> Sentences where choices are being made have something can make a decision
  and does make the decision.  For example:

  <ul>

    <li> <i>startle</i>: Ed jumped out of the bushes yelling like an idiot and
    <i>startled</i> his poor sister.

    <li> <i>forget</i>: After he apologized, I decided to <i>forget</i> about
    Bill's insult.

    <li> <i>wash</i>: Joe <i>washed</i> my car in the driveway this morning.

Write Creative Sentences,We'll give you a list of actions (plus ideas for who is doing the action).  You write a sentence where the action is done in a certain way / style.  Possible bonus for creativity.,creative write sentence transitivity nouns verbs writing generation bonus reward,aspect_volition,"<ul>

  <li> We'll show you an action (represented by a video), things that can do the
  action, and some things the action can be done to, and you'll write two
  sentences combining them together.

  <li> We're interested in how the concept of choice is expressed.  One sentence
  you write will be where the thing doing the action <b>actively chose to do the
  action</b>.  The other sentence will be where the thing doing the action
  <b>did not or cannot choose to do the action</b>.

  <li> The suggested things that can do the action or that can have the action
  done to them are ideas to get your creative juices flowing.  They came
  from other people on Mechanical Turk, so some of them might not make sense
  (nobody's perfect); if so, please ignore them.  You don't have to use the
  suggested things that can do the action or things that the action can be done
  to.  <b>The only requirement is that you use a form of the specified action
  and to have the sentence reflect that a choice is (or is not) being made.</b>

  <li> There many different reasons why sentences have actions where choices are
not being made.  For example, the thing doing the action might have done it
automatically or might be incabable of making decisions.  Here are some examples
of sentences where choices are <b>not</b> being made.

       <ul>
        <li> <i>startle</i>: The picture <i>startled</i> George
        <li> <i>forget</i>: Sarah <i>forgot</i> Joe's name
        <li> <i>wash</i>: The sidewalk was <i>washed</i> by the rain.
       </ul>

  <li> Note that we're interested in choices being made, not the motivations
  behind the choices.  If someone is forced to do something, they still
  conciously decide to do it.

  <li> Sentences where choices are being made have something can make a decision
  and does make the decision.  For example:

  <ul>

    <li> <i>startle</i>: Ed jumped out of the bushes yelling like an idiot and
    <i>startled</i> his poor sister.

    <li> <i>forget</i>: After he apologized, I decided to <i>forget</i> about
    Bill's insult.

    <li> <i>wash</i>: Joe <i>washed</i> my car in the driveway this morning.

Write Creative Sentences,We'll give you a list of actions (plus ideas for who is doing the action).  You write a sentence where the action is done in a certain way / style.  Possible bonus for creativity.,creative write sentence transitivity nouns verbs writing generation bonus reward,aspect_volition,"<ul>

  <li> We'll show you an action (represented by a video), things that can do the
  action, and some things the action can be done to, and you'll write two
  sentences combining them together.

  <li> We're interested in how the concept of choice is expressed.  One sentence
  you write will be where the thing doing the action <b>actively chose to do the
  action</b>.  The other sentence will be where the thing doing the action
  <b>did not or cannot choose to do the action</b>.

  <li> The suggested things that can do the action or that can have the action
  done to them are ideas to get your creative juices flowing.  They came
  from other people on Mechanical Turk, so some of them might not make sense
  (nobody's perfect); if so, please ignore them.  You don't have to use the
  suggested things that can do the action or things that the action can be done
  to.  <b>The only requirement is that you use a form of the specified action
  and to have the sentence reflect that a choice is (or is not) being made.</b>

  <li> There many different reasons why sentences have actions where choices are
not being made.  For example, the thing doing the action might have done it
automatically or might be incabable of making decisions.  Here are some examples
of sentences where choices are <b>not</b> being made.

       <ul>
        <li> <i>startle</i>: The picture <i>startled</i> George
        <li> <i>forget</i>: Sarah <i>forgot</i> Joe's name
        <li> <i>wash</i>: The sidewalk was <i>washed</i> by the rain.
       </ul>

  <li> Note that we're interested in choices being made, not the motivations
  behind the choices.  If someone is forced to do something, they still
  conciously decide to do it.

  <li> Sentences where choices are being made have something can make a decision
  and does make the decision.  For example:

  <ul>

    <li> <i>startle</i>: Ed jumped out of the bushes yelling like an idiot and
    <i>startled</i> his poor sister.

    <li> <i>forget</i>: After he apologized, I decided to <i>forget</i> about
    Bill's insult.

    <li> <i>wash</i>: Joe <i>washed</i> my car in the driveway this morning.

  </ul>

  <li> It might not be possible to write a sentence with the action and
  properties as given.  If so, click the box that says ""it's not possible to
  write such a sentence.""


  <li> Please make sure your sentences make sense and that you try to answer all
  of the questions.  Incomplete or incoherent responses will be rejected.

  <li> We'll pay a bonus for particularly creative sentences (something that
  makes sense and wouldn't look out of place in a book or newspaper).

Write Creative Sentences,We'll give you a list of actions (plus ideas for who is doing the action).  You write a sentence where the action is done in a certain way / style.  Possible bonus for creativity.,creative write sentence transitivity nouns verbs writing generation bonus reward,punctuality,"<ul>

  <li> We'll show you an action (represented by a video), things that can do the
  action, and some things the action can be done to.  You'll write two sentences
  combining them together.

  <li> We're interested in how the concept of time is expressed.  One sentence
  you write will be where the action <b>took a short period of time</b>.  The
  other sentence will be where the the action <b>took a long period of time</b>.

  <li> The suggested things that can do the action or that can have the action
  done to them are ideas to get your creative juices flowing.  They came from
  other people on Mechanical Turk, so some of them might not make sense
  (nobody's perfect); if so, please ignore them.  You don't have to use the
  suggested things that can do the action or things that the action can be done
  to.  <b>The only requirement is that you use a form of the specified action
  and to have the sentence <b>reflect the appropriate amount of time needed to
  complete the action</b>.

  <li> There are many different reasons why the actions expressed in sentences
  don't take a short period of time.  For example, the action might be about
  what something ""is"" rather than what it does, or the action itself might take
  a long time or be ongoing.  Here are some examples of sentences
  where actions do <b>not</b> happen in a short period of time.

       <ul>
        <li> <i>kick</i>: Pele <i>kicked</i> the ball at Manfred.
        <li> <i>touch</i>: Caroline <i>touched</i> her ID card against the scanner to get through the locked door.
        <li> <i>thank</i>: Charlie <i>thanked</i> the candyman with a nod as he ran out of the store.

  <li> Sentences where actions take a long time (or an indeterminate amount of
  time) could never be entirely captured in a short YouTube video.  Here are
  some examples:

Write Creative Sentences,We'll give you a list of actions (plus ideas for who is doing the action).  You write a sentence where the action is done in a certain way / style.  Possible bonus for creativity.,creative write sentence transitivity nouns verbs writing generation bonus reward,punctuality,"<ul>

  <li> We'll show you an action (represented by a video), things that can do the
  action, and some things the action can be done to.  You'll write two sentences
  combining them together.

  <li> We're interested in how the concept of time is expressed.  One sentence
  you write will be where the action <b>took a short period of time</b>.  The
  other sentence will be where the the action <b>took a long period of time</b>.

  <li> The suggested things that can do the action or that can have the action
  done to them are ideas to get your creative juices flowing.  They came from
  other people on Mechanical Turk, so some of them might not make sense
  (nobody's perfect); if so, please ignore them.  You don't have to use the
  suggested things that can do the action or things that the action can be done
  to.  <b>The only requirement is that you use a form of the specified action
  and to have the sentence <b>reflect the appropriate amount of time needed to
  complete the action</b>.

  <li> There are many different reasons why the actions expressed in sentences
  don't take a short period of time.  For example, the action might be about
  what something ""is"" rather than what it does, or the action itself might take
  a long time or be ongoing.  Here are some examples of sentences
  where actions do <b>not</b> happen in a short period of time.

       <ul>
        <li> <i>kick</i>: Pele <i>kicked</i> the ball at Manfred.
        <li> <i>touch</i>: Caroline <i>touched</i> her ID card against the scanner to get through the locked door.
        <li> <i>thank</i>: Charlie <i>thanked</i> the candyman with a nod as he ran out of the store.
       </ul>

  <li> Sentences where actions take a long time (or an indeterminate amount of
  time) could never be entirely captured in a short YouTube video.  Here are
  some examples:

  <ul>

    <li> <i>find</i>: Brightly colored feathers are <i>found</i> in the plumage of Amazonian birds.

    <li> <i>touch</i>: I was <i>touched</i> by how much Irene helped me when I broke my leg.

    <li> <i>thank</i>: We <i>thank</i> the Gods for their protection by praying in the temple and offering sacrifices every morning.

  </ul>

  <li> For a particular action, its quite likely that <b>you might not be
  possible to write a sentence with the action and properties as given</b>.  If
  so, click the box that says ""it's not possible to write such a sentence.""
  However, for each action, you should be able to supply a sentence with one of
  the two properties.


  <li> Please make sure your sentences make sense and that you try to answer all
  of the questions.  Incomplete or incoherent responses will be rejected.

Write Creative Sentences,We'll give you a list of actions (plus ideas for who is doing the action).  You write a sentence where the action is done in a certain way / style.  Possible bonus for creativity.,creative write sentence transitivity nouns verbs writing generation bonus reward,harm,"<ul>

  <li> We'll show you an action (represented by a video), things that can do the
  action, and some things the action can be done to, and you'll write two
  sentences combining them together.

  <li> We're interested in how the concept of harm is expressed.  One
  sentence you write will be where the thing to which the action was done
  <b>was harmed</b>.  The other sentence will be where the thing doing the action
  <b>was not affected</b>.

  <li> The suggested things that can do the action or that can have the action
  done to them are ideas to get your creative juices flowing.  They came
  from other people on Mechanical Turk, so some of them might not make sense
  (nobody's perfect); if so, please ignore them.  You don't have to use the
  suggested things that can do the action or things that the action can be done
  to.  <b>The only requirement is that you use a form of the specified action
  and to have the sentence reflect that the action harmed something (or not).</b>

  <li> There are a number of different reasons why sentences might have
  been harmed.  The action changes the the object, or the action has some innate
  negative connotation, or the sentence makes it clear.  Here are some sentences
  where the thing to which the action is done <b>is harmed</b>:

       <ul>
        <li> <i>kill</i>: The wolf <i>killed</i> the little bunny.
        <li> <i>bomb</i>: The bus was <i>bombed</i> by terrorists.
        <li> <i>gave</i>: Mary <i>gave</i> Bob a bad performance review.
       </ul>

  <li> Sentences where the object is unaffected are ones in which the object
  might not even know the action happened or where the thing to which action is
  being done is not present.

  <ul>

    <li> <i>thought</i>: Ed </i>thought</i> about Jill.

    <li> <i>wave</i>: Melanie <i>waved</i> at a cop in Toledo.

    <li> <i>shine</i>: The stars <i>shined</i> in the sky.

  </ul>

  <li> It might not be possible to write a sentence with the action and
  properties as given.  If so, click the box that says ""it's not possible to
  write such a sentence.""

  <li> Don't try too hard to force sentences where the thing to which the action
  was done benefits (or not).  It might be impossible to write such a sentence;
  however, in such cases you should be able to write a sentence of the other
  type.

  <li> Please make sure your sentences make sense and that you try to answer all
  of the questions.  Incomplete or incoherent responses will be rejected.

  <li> We'll pay a bonus for particularly creative sentences (something that
  makes sense and wouldn't look out of place in a book or newspaper).

Write Creative Sentences,We'll give you a list of actions (plus ideas for who is doing the action).  You write a sentence where the action is done in a certain way / style.  Possible bonus for creativity.,creative write sentence transitivity nouns verbs writing generation bonus reward,kinesis,"<ul>

  <li> We'll show you an action (represented by a video), things that can do the
  action, and some things the action can be done to, and you'll write two
  sentences combining them together.

  <li> We're interested in how the concept of movement is expressed.  One sentence
  you write will be where the thing doing the action <b>moves while performing the 
  action</b>.  The other sentence will be where the thing doing the action
  <b>does not move while performing the action</b>.

  <li> The suggested things that can do the action or that can have the action
  done to them are ideas to get your creative juices flowing.  They came
  from other people on Mechanical Turk, so some of them might not make sense
  (nobody's perfect); if so, please ignore them.  You don't have to use the
  suggested things that can do the action or things that the action can be done
  to.  <b>The only requirement is that you use a form of the specified action
  and to have the sentence reflect that movement is (or is not) happening.</b>

  <li> There are a number of different reasons why sentences might not have
  movement.  The thing doing the action might not have a physical presence or
  the ""action"" is actually a thought or a state which doesn't require any
  movement.  Here are some sentences where movement is <b>not</b> taking place.

       <ul>
        <li> <i>push</i>: I pushed myself to finish the project.
        <li> <i>jumped</i>: The corporation <i>jumped</i> to a silly conclusion.
        <li> <i>like</i>: John <i>likes</i> beer.
       </ul>

  <li> Sentences where movement happens clearly have someone or something
  performing a physical action.  For example:

  <ul>

    <li> <i>push</i>: Ed </i>pushed</i> his poor sister into the lake.

    <li> <i>jumped</i>: Sue <i>jumped</i> out of an airplane.

    <li> <i>wash</i>: Joe <i>washed</i> my car in the driveway this morning.

  </ul>

  <li> It might not be possible to write a sentence with the action and
  properties as given.  If so, click the box that says ""it's not possible to
  write such a sentence.""

  <li> Note that we're interested in what happens with the action happens, not
  what happens before or after.  It's okay to say that it's impossible to write
  sentences; however, if you can't write a sentence with motion, you should be
  able to write one without (and the other way around).

  <li> Please make sure your sentences make sense and that you try to answer all
  of the questions.  Incomplete or incoherent responses will be rejected.

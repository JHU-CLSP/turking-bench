            <h1>Judge the quality of similar sentences</h1>
            <p>Please read the groups of sentences below.  Each group 	      contains an original sentence along with some variations of it.  Your job is to grade the quality of the variations with two 5-point scales: <b>meaning</b> and <b>grammar</b>.&nbsp;</p>
            Meaning
            <ul>
                <li><b>5 - identical</b>: All of the meaning of the original sentence is retained, and nothing is added</li>
                <li><b>4 - minor differences</b>:	The meaning of the original sentence is retained, although some minor information may be deleted or added without too great a difference in meaning</li>
                <li><b>3 - moderate differences</b>:	Some of the meaning of the original sentence is retained, although a non-trivial amount of information was deleted or added</li>
                <li><b>2 - substantially different</b>:	Substantial amount of the meaning is different</li>
                <li><b>1 - completely different</b>:	The variation doesn't mean anything close to the original sentence</li>
            </ul>
            Grammar
            <ul>
                <li><b>5 - perfect</b>:	The sentence is perfectly grammatical</li>
                <li><b>4 - ok but awkward</b>:	The sentence is grammatical, but might sound slightly awkward</li>
                <li><b>3 - one error</b>:	The sentence has an error (such as an agreement error between  subject and verb, a plural noun with a singular determiner, or the wrong verb form)</li>
                <li><b>2 - many errors</b>:	The sentence has multiple errors or omits words that would be required to make it grammatical</li>
                <li><b>1 - ungrammatical</b>:	The sentence is totally ungrammatical</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here is an example of how we graded a pair of sentences:</p>
            <table cellspacing="0">
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th colspan="3">Original sentence:</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td colspan="3">US doubts were redoubled by news that the coup was to be led by Major Giraldi , a close associate of the Panamanian military dictator .</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Variation:</th>
                        <th>Meaning</th>
                        <th>Grammar</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>The coup was led by Giraldi , a close associate .</td>
                        <td align="center">3</td>
                        <td align="center">4</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            We gave this variation a "4" for grammar because it is grammatical but it sounds like there is something missing at the end of the sentence (a close associate of whom?). We gave it a "3" for meaning because some of the meaning of the original sentence is still there but a lot of the meaning is missing.</td>
